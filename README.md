# Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune Camera Tools

Camera tools for the HD Era WMMT games, currently only works for 5DX+ (Rev 3.00).

### __Epilepsy Warning!!!__

Due to the early state of the camera, there are still many issues, that includes __rapid flickering__ when enabling the cam scripts <u>without freezing the camera</u>

### Special thanks 
[doomertheboomer](https://github.com/doomertheboomer) for the coding the free fly camera!



## Features
1. Free Fly Camera
2. Orbit Camera (Tied to Player Car, does not follow rotation)
3. Tracking Camera (Incomplete free fly movement, movement direction does not follow camera rotation yet)
4. Tracking Camera tied to car
5. Customizable chase camera
6. Mounted Camera, Basically customizable chase camera with rotation controls
